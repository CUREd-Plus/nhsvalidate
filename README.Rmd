# NHS Digital Artificial Data

NHS Digital make [artificial data](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/artificial-data) available for three sets of data
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, A&E, Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient. They provide two sets for each a
sample and a full which are identical except in size (rows).

## Validation

The aim is to validate these data samples against the XML Schema provided at the [Technology Reference Update Distribution
(TRUD)](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/home)+ which in this instance refers to several different
aspects.

### Validation

The first thing to check is that the data as provided has variables which are as they are defined in the XML Schema,
that is to say a string variable with a maximum length of 10 characters doesn't have > 10 characters in it. Dates and
times are formatted as stated.

Summaries of data completeness can then be made to show how much missing data there is.

### Consistency

Because a lot of events are temporarily related a number of checks can be made to ensure they are logically
consistent. For example someones date of death can not predate their date of birth, or their date of discharge can not
predate their admission date and so forth.

### Duplicates

Checks can also be made for duplicated data where rows of observations pertain to the same individual identifiers when
they shouldn't.

## Data Validation

The XML Schema form the basis of validation `rule_set()` from the [dataverifyr](https://github.com/DavZim/dataverifyr)
package. To create these rules automatically from a given XML Schema use the `xml_2_rule_set()` function as shown below.
